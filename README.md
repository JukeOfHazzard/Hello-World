# Hello-World
Learning how to use GitHub

This is how I am learning how to use GitHub and work with repositories and also making a YouTube Video afterwards.

My software simply displays the words "Hello World" in the terminal for the user to read.

The Software I made was to see if I can edit repositories in GitHub.

## Development Environment
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.8 32-bit
* Git / GitHub 

Python is a very user friendly code that is easy to use, read, and understand. The following is how it was done:
1. Make the Python code to display "Hello World".
        Uses `print("Hello World")` which is using python language
2. Then press the green triangle at near the top right hand part of the application to run the code
3. The result should be displayed in the terminal on the botto of the application screen

The Use of Visual Studio Code is a plateform and application where I can use different
languages if I need to use them with different people.
GitHub will allow me to share my work with other people and edit codes of others remotely.
